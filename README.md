## The content provides an overview of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), its history, and its advantages.

### Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a systematic process for developing high-quality software within a predictable timeframe and budget.
It consists of distinct phases that help in planning, designing, and developing software, allowing for an iterative approach.

### History and Evolution of the SDLC

The SDLC began to take shape in the mid-1960s due to the increasing complexity of software development.
Initially, it utilized the "waterfall method," which follows a linear progression through stages, but has since adapted to more iterative methods to better meet customer needs.

### Key Advantages of the SDLC

Provides a structured process that enhances efficiency and reduces risks compared to ad hoc approaches.
Facilitates clear communication among stakeholders and team members, with well-defined roles and responsibilities, allowing for timely problem-solving and iteration.
