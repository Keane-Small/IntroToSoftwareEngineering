## The content provides an overview of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC), its history, and its advantages.

### Understanding the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)

The SDLC is a systematic process for developing high-quality software within a predictable timeframe and budget.
It consists of distinct phases that help in planning, designing, and developing software, allowing for an iterative approach.

### History and Evolution of the SDLC

The SDLC began to take shape in the mid-1960s due to the increasing complexity of software development.
Initially, it utilized the "waterfall method," which follows a linear progression through stages, but has since adapted to more iterative methods to better meet customer needs.

### Key Advantages of the SDLC

Provides a structured process that enhances efficiency and reduces risks compared to ad hoc approaches.
Facilitates clear communication among stakeholders and team members, with well-defined roles and responsibilities, allowing for timely problem-solving and iteration.

### Phases of the SDLC

The SDLC consists of six phases: planning, design, development, testing, deployment, and maintenance.
Each phase is distinct, with no overlap in tasks, and the process can be linear or iterative based on requirements.

### Planning and Design

In the planning phase, requirements are gathered and documented in a Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document.
The design phase involves creating the software architecture based on the SRS, leading to the development of a design document.

### Development and Testing

The development phase is where coding occurs, guided by the design document.
The testing phase ensures the code is stable and meets requirements through various testing methods, including unit and integration testing.

### Deployment and Maintenance

Deployment involves releasing the application to users, often in stages.
The maintenance phase addresses any bugs or enhancements needed after deployment, allowing for continuous improvement in future cycles.

### Requirements Gathering

Involves collecting and documenting the software's necessary requirements, often using a Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
Requirements can be categorized into functional, external/UI, system features, and non-functional types.

### Software Design and Coding

Transforms requirements into a structured design that developers can implement in code, defining system architecture and components.
Coding for quality emphasizes maintainability, readability, and adherence to coding standards, using tools like linters for error detection.

### Testing, Releases, and Documentation

Software testing verifies that the software meets requirements and is free of bugs, with levels including unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing.
Releases are categorized as alpha, beta, and general availability (GA), each serving different audiences and purposes.
Documentation is crucial for both technical and non-technical users, providing guidance on software operation and usage.

### Requirements Gathering Process

Involves six steps: identifying stakeholders, establishing goals and objectives, eliciting requirements, documenting requirements, analyzing and confirming requirements, and prioritizing.
Stakeholders include decision-makers, end-users, and other personnel from the organization requesting the software.

### Documentation Types

User Requirements Specification (URS) captures user stories and expectations from the software.
Software Requirements Specification (SRS) outlines functionalities, performance benchmarks, and categorizes requirements into functional, external interface, system features, and non-functional requirements.
System Requirements Specification (SysRS) provides a broader scope, detailing system capabilities, interfaces, and various requirements including policy and performance.

## This course content focuses on various software development methodologies, specifically the Waterfall, V-shape model, and Agile methods.

### Waterfall Method

A sequential approach where each phase must be completed before the next begins, with all planning done upfront.
The customer typically sees the product only during the testing phase, leading to long intervals between releases.

### V-shape Model

Similar to Waterfall but emphasizes verification and validation phases, forming a V shape.
Each verification phase corresponds to a validation phase, allowing for structured testing but still lacking flexibility for changes.

### Agile Method

An iterative approach that promotes collaboration and short development cycles (sprints), allowing for ongoing feedback and adjustments.
Agile focuses on delivering a minimum viable product (MVP) quickly, accommodating changing requirements more effectively than traditional methods.

### Overall Comparison

Waterfall and V-shape are sequential and rigid, making them less adaptable to changes.
Agile is more flexible and responsive to feedback, though it can complicate upfront planning and resource allocation.

### Software Versioning

Software version numbers provide essential information about the program, including release dates, updates, and minor changes.
Version numbers can vary in length and format, typically consisting of 2 to 4 number sets separated by periods.

### Semantic Versioning

Some version numbers follow a semantic numbering system with four parts: major changes, minor changes, patches, and build numbers.
This system helps users understand the extent of changes made to the software.

### Compatibility Issues

Compatibility between old and new software versions can be problematic, and checking version numbers can help identify outdated software.
Some software is designed to be backwards compatible, allowing older versions to work with newer updates.
